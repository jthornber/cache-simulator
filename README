This program experiments with different cache replacement policies
with a view to using them in the device-mapper cache target.

The simulator builds a couple of probability density functions out of
gaussian and uniform functions.  Then builds sequences of ios from
these.  Obnoxious linear scans are also thrown in.

A successful cache policy will have to be resistant to linear scans,
and be able to spot when the io pattern has changed and prioritise
different blocks.

Unlike memory caches we don't _have_ to map an origin block into the
cache.  Indeed since the copying is expensive, we should try very hard
to only copy blocks that we feel are going to be hit a lot.
